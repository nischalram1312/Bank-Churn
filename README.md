# Bank-Churn
The end goal of this project was to predict if the customer will retain their account with the
bank. In order to accomplish this, i first had to explore the data and find necessary features
which correlate or have an effect on the final decision or target variable and then put the
data through models like Decision Tree Regression to get the prediction.
